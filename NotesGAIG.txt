Scripting notes

in notepad++, for bash scripts, select "S" (shell) for language
all bash scripts start with #!/bin/bash
printf needs to be told to go to next line with \n (escape new line). To add a blank line, have to use \n\n
when copying script from notepad++ to script on server, go to colon prompt (:) and type 1,$d to empty the file before pasteing in from notepad++
to end case statement, use esac
to end if statement, use fi
in shell, can type echo PATH, in order to show the paths that are loaded as environment variables
system variables are always in CAPS i.e. PATH
